üö≤ SQL BikeStores Analysis
üìå Project Overview

This project contains a collection of SQL queries applied on the BikeStores database.
The aim is to demonstrate proficiency in SQL by covering different topics such as joins, aggregations, subqueries, common table expressions (CTEs), and window functions.

üóÑÔ∏è Database

The project is based on the BikeStores sample database
.
It contains sales data (customers, orders, stores, staffs), and production data (products, brands, categories).

‚úÖ Topics Covered

The queries in this project demonstrate:

Basic SQL Queries: SELECT, filtering with WHERE, and sorting with ORDER BY.

JOINs: Inner Join, Left Join, combining multiple tables.

Aggregate Functions: SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX.

Grouping: GROUP BY and filtering with HAVING.

Subqueries: Used in WHERE, EXISTS, and IN clauses.

Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Simplifying complex queries.

Window Functions:

Ranking: RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER().

Aggregates: Running totals, moving averages.

Navigation: LAG(), LEAD().

üìå Example Queries
1. Products priced above average
SELECT P.product_id, 
       P.product_name, 
       P.list_price,  
       (SELECT AVG(list_price) FROM production.products) AS avg_price,
       P.list_price - (SELECT AVG(list_price) FROM production.products) AS price_diff
FROM production.products P
WHERE P.list_price >= (SELECT AVG(list_price) FROM production.products)
ORDER BY P.list_price DESC;

2. Top 3 best-selling products in each category
WITH TopRank AS (
    SELECT  C.category_name, 
            P.product_name, 
            SUM(OI.quantity) AS total_quantity, 
            DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY C.category_name ORDER BY SUM(OI.quantity) DESC) AS q_rank
    FROM production.products P 
    JOIN production.categories C ON P.category_id = C.category_id
    JOIN sales.order_items OI ON OI.product_id = P.product_id
    GROUP BY P.product_name, C.category_name
)
SELECT *
FROM TopRank
WHERE q_rank <= 3;
